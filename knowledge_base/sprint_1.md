# Frontend Functionality Checklist for Supabase Integration

## Sidebar Functionality
- [ ] **Fetch and Display Clients for an Organization**
  - [ ] Query the Supabase database for all clients associated with the current organization.
    - [ ] Verify that the query correctly filters by organization ID.
    - [ ] Ensure that client data includes necessary identifiers and names.
  - [ ] Dynamically render the client list in the sidebar.
    - [ ] Create a sidebar component that lists all clients.
    - [ ] Style the list for clarity and ease of navigation.
- [ ] **Implement Client Detail View on Click**
  - [ ] Attach click event handlers to each client name in the sidebar.
  - [ ] On client click, load and display the relevant client details.
    - [ ] Fetch additional data (e.g., profile info, related threads/tweets) as needed.
    - [ ] Ensure smooth transitions and proper loading states.

## Hero Section Updates
- [ ] **Display Welcome Username Instead of User ID**
  - [ ] Identify the component currently showing the user ID.
  - [ ] Replace the user ID with the client's username.
    - [ ] Ensure the username is correctly fetched from Supabase.
    - [ ] Update the UI text to read something like "Welcome, [username]!"
- [ ] **Add Profile Picture to the Hero Section**
  - [ ] Retrieve the clientâ€™s Twitter profile PNG URL.
    - [ ] Confirm that the URL points to a valid PNG image.
  - [ ] Integrate the profile picture into the hero section layout.
    - [ ] Place the profile picture alongside the welcome username.
    - [ ] Add error handling or a fallback image if the profile picture fails to load.
